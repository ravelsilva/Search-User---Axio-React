## Description

This is a user search application developed with **React** as a test for an interview challenge. The goal of the project was to create an application that requests data from an API and displays user information, including their avatars and job titles.

The application utilizes the API [http://dummyjson.com/users](http://dummyjson.com/users) to fetch user data and allows users to search by name, filtering the results in real time.

## Features

- **User Search**: Allows users to type a name to filter the user results in real time.
- **Profile Listing**: Displays the name, job title, and avatar of each found user.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface is designed to be user-friendly and responsive, adapting to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Axios**: Library for making HTTP requests in a simple and effective manner.
- **CSS**: Styling of the application, utilizing Flexbox for a responsive layout.
- **Google Fonts**: For typographic styling.
